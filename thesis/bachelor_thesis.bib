In this article, we describe an efﬁcient and exact sampling routine for the VNDF of the GGX microfacet distribution. This routine leverages the property that GGX is the distribution of normals of a truncated ellipsoid, and sampling the GGX VNDF is equivalent to sampling the 2D projection of this truncated ellipsoid. To do that, we simplify the problem by using the linear transformation that maps the truncated ellipsoid to a hemisphere. Since linear transformations preserve the uniformity of projected areas, sampling in the hemisphere conﬁguration and transforming the samples back to the ellipsoid conﬁguration yields valid samples from the GGX VNDF.},

The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features : simplicity  (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).

Our main motivation is to deﬁne a correct (geometrically indicated), physically based masking function for application in microfacet models, as well as the properties that function should exhibit. Indeed, several different masking functions are often presented in the literature and making the right choice is not always obvious. We start by showing that physically based masking functions are constrained by the projected area of the visible microsurface onto the outgoing direction. We use this property to derive the distribution of visible normals from the microsurface, whose normalization factor is the masking function. We then show how the common form of microfacet-based BRDFs emerges from this distribution. As a consequence, the masking function is related to the correct normalization of microfacetbased BRDFs. However, while the correct masking function satisﬁes these normalization constraints, its explicit form is can only be determined for a given microsurface proﬁle.},

In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of "rays" extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

Applications in rendering include distribution ray tracing, Monte Carlo path tracing, and form-factor computation for radiosity methods. In these cases variance can often be signiﬁcantly reduced by drawing samples from several distributions, each designed to sample well some difﬁcult aspect of the integrand. Normally this is done by explicitly partitioning the integration domain into regions that are sampled differently. We present a powerful alternative for constructing robust Monte Carlo estimators, by combining samples from several distributions in a way that is provably good. These estimators are unbiased, and can reduce variance signiﬁcantly at little additional cost. We present experiments and measurements from several areas in rendering: calculation of glossy highlights from area light sources, the “ﬁnal gather” pass of some radiosity algorithms, and direct solution of the rendering equation using bidirectional path tracing.},
